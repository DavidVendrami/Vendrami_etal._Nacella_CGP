Code availability for analysis of Nacella CGP

Within this repository there are the codes for the analysis of the Nacella CGP work that is currently under review. It should soon appear on bioRxiv.

This repository is definitely a work still in progress and I deeply apologize to anybody who will find it hard to follow the scripts (as a good deal of them is without
proper comments...). Please do not hesitate to contact me at david.vendrami@edu.unife.it for clarifications that I will be happy to provide promptly.
