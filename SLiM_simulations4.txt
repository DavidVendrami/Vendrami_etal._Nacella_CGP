### SLiM

## Fourth set of simulations:
# Input .slim files in "SLiM set four". You need 100 files that generate vcf
# files with different names (i.e.: ...1.vcf, ...2.vcf, ...N.vcf, ...100.vcf).

# Run them with the script:
slim INPUT_1 > OUTPUT_1.txt
slim INPUT_2 > OUTPUT_2.txt
slim INPUT_N > OUTPUT_N.txt
slim INPUT_100 > OUTPUT_100.txt

# !!! For being comparable they should be run with the same 100 seeds.

# Nucleotide diversity values can be calculated using vcftools as in "SLiM_simulations3.txt"
# And processed separately for the various time points.
# These can then be plotted for the 5 populations from the 5 timepoints.
